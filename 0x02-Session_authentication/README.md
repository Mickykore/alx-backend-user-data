# 0x02. Session authentication

## Background

In this project, you will implement a Session Authentication. You are not allowed to install any other module.

In the industry, you should not implement your own Session authentication system and use a module or framework that doing it for you (like in Python-Flask: [Flask-HTTPAuth](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/_ZTQTaMKjx1S_xATshexkA)). Here, for the learning purpose, we will walk through each step of this mechanism to understand it by doing.

## Resources

Before proceeding, it's recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [REST API Authentication Mechanisms - Only the session auth part](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/oofk0VhuS0ZFZTNTVrQeaQ)
- [HTTP Cookie](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/peLV8xuJ4PDJMOVFqk-d2g)
- [Flask ](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/AI1tFR5XriGfR8Tz7YTYQA)
- [Flask Cookie](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/QYfI5oW6OHUmHDzwKV1Qsw)

## Learning Objectives

### General

- The concept of authentication and its importance in securing resources.
- Understanding session authentication and how it simplifies user interaction by maintaining session state.
- The role of Cookies in web-based authentication systems.
- How to send and parse Cookies for maintaining session information.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7).
- All your files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory.
- Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).
- All your files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.
